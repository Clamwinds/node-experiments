// I need to just use some bitcoin related libraries so I have to force myself with familiarity with the javascript common lisp system, I think I can try to make dedicated software with common lisp and javascript or maybe clojure and try to work a niche in the commercial javascript market, that sounds like the most profitable future.

//Maybe i'm not thinking of a project with enough technical comp[lexity or I don't have the vision to sustain that (yet) so I need to think of something like thr set of elements 'nodejs' or maybe 'react' is, programming the major library ecosystems for sale in the commercial JS market and then delivering workable apps or apps that scale or something with it? Say like a

//common lisp -> javascript
//common lisp nodejs instance
//common lisp that can call any nodejs library
